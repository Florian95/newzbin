open a new newzbin connection, and search it with the method provided. Pass it vars to narrow the search
Download the nzb using the provided get_nzb method

# You need to pass in Newzbin's required cookies in order to get rich metadata attributes on the nzbs
# If you don't you can still search, you just dont get values like resolution, source, and audio data etc.
newz = Newzbin::Connection.new('username', 'password')


nzbs = newz.search( :q => 'independence day', :ps_rb_video_format => 16, :category => 6 )

puts nzbs.inspect
puts nzbs.first.title => 
puts nzbs.first.attributes.inspect


newz.get_nzb(nzbs.first.id) => downloads the nzb file
